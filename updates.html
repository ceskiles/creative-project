      <h1>COVID-19 UPDATES</h1>
      <p>The spread of the coronavirus has caused numerous closures and restrictions
        that impact our plans for the wedding, forcing us to adapt.<br />
        <p>Thank you for your patience during these uncertain times, and as we
          strive to adapt our plans to the closures and restrictions that are
          and will be in place. Please check back here for the most up to
          date information.</p>
        <p>with love,<br><em>Ashley and Caleb</em></p>

        <p><strong>Please cross-check the information on this cite with the
            following updates</strong></p>
        <ul class='alerts'>
          <li>We are happy to announce that after a challenging series of events
            <strong>we have been sealed</strong> in the <strong>Mount Timpanogos Utah Temple</strong>
            on <strong>March 25th, 2020</strong>. The temple closed to all ordinances as we
            walked out, the doors locking behind us. We are grateful for the
            many prayers which allowed us to be so fortunate.</li>
          <li>We plan to be sealed in the Provo City Center Temple on March 28th.
            We welcome your prayers for our parents safe travel to Utah for
            that weekend so that we can be sealed before further closures occur.</li>
          <li>We do not expect the sealing in Washington to be possible, we are making
            plans to be sealed sooner before further temple closures occur.</li>
          <li>Our sealing will be severely limited in group size, and we apologize to family and
            friends who will not be able to attend.</li>
          <li><strong>The Reception (WA) will be postponed</strong> until it is safe to hold
            large group events.</li>
          <li><strong>The Open House (WA) will most likely be postponed</strong> until it is safe to hold
            large group events.</li>
          <li>We have not yet made our Target and Amazon registries public, but will
            soon and appreciate any help as we start our life together, despite the
            postponement of celebrations.</li>
